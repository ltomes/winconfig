# chocolatey config

This repo contains 5 sets of configs I use for different tasks.
They can be called directly from chocolatey via `choco install %~dp0\gaming.config` 
To run this command without prompts run `choco install %~dp0\gaming.config all -y`

To install all software I use, simply run the `installAll.bat` script as admin.
